Innovating the Digital Ultrasound Technology,

HITACHI
RF Hayashi Tey

From the transmission of
ultrasound beams to image
processing and post
processing, all functions are
_ fully digitized and
_ computerized. As a result,
image quality and diagnostic
_ functions have been
improved and maximized. »
Hitachi continues to be the
innovator in ultrasound
technology.

Digital Beam Forming

Improving ultrasound beam quality through the use of digital beam forming techniques.

@Quadra Beam
Receiving

Quadra beam receiving technology allows
the system to receive acoustic data from
the patient at a rate four times faster. The
clinician greatly benefits from improved
images with detail collected using this high
line density processing system. Color flow
frame rates are also optimized for
maximum temporal resolution.

@ Dynamic Tissue Harmonic
Imaging (dTHI)

When the ultrasound passes through

the body, harmonic distortion increases

by varying degrees.

By extracting higher harmonic echo,

fine and high contrast image can be

depicted even at greater depths.

@Two Dimensional (2D)

Beam Apodisation
Expanding acoustic aperture wider, the
transmitting beam can be converged
narrower, but side lobes are increased
relatively. However the grating side
lobes can be reduced by emitting the
beam in gibhous profile.

Transmission wave in rectangular form
gives high emission power but it is
distorted to fusiform and effective
acoustic energy is reduced drastically.

Previously applying the fusiform profile
to the transmission wave, such
distortion can be  preventively
eliminated.

These two dimensional, acoustic wise
and time wise apodisation bring on
superior image quality.

2D apodisation

@ Dot Focusing
Technology
The number of focus points is increased
up to forming a dotted line through out
the entire field of scan line, by
microfocusing technology of continuous

aperture optimization.

Together with eight setting electronic
focuses on transmission, sharp image is
available.

@Rapid change-over time

Typically, one of the weak links in digital
ultrasound systems has been the delay
"change-over time" when selecting from
one transducer or application to another.
With the EUB-6000 there is virtually no
delay.

We never keep you waiting.

@Real-time biplane imaging

The real-time biplane imaging function
is the unique technique available only
from Hitach, which offers simultaneous
imaging of axial, and transaxial planes.
By adopting the real-time biplane
technique to the esophageal probe,
simultaneous imaging of axial and
transaxial planes of the heart becomes
possible from the esophagus.

@Zoom Flexibility

Due to Quadra beam processing, the
EUB-6000 provides the clinician the
ability to zoom even after freezing the
image.

Optimal Color Flow Imaging...

Color Flow Mapping(CFM)

Provides real-time observation in color of the dynamic state
and characteristics (flow direction, velocity, velocity variance,
etc.) of the blood flow in the abdominal, vascular, and other
regions.

vELOS Bila nei” BA bad Barwa

Color hold mode display

Large cine memory capacity enables multilayered storage of
selected color flow images for later retrieval and review.
Depicts all vessels, even peripherals, without motion artifact
disturbance.

Color Flow Angiography(CFA)

Obtains image from the reflection intensity of blood flow
signals, and displays it overlapped on a B-Mode image.
Effective for detecting very slow blood flows, such as that in
small vessels. Since the image is independent from blood flow
velocity, all flows from very slow to high speed are displayed
without discrimination.

Peak hold mode display

Color flow images can be accumulated continuously for real-
time observation. Time spans are selectable -- 1 sec., 2 secs., 4
secs., or infinite -- and at the end of the given span, a fresh
sequence of images is provided. Extremely useful, particularly
for complicated screening exams.

Directional Color Flow Angiography(Directional CFA)

The CFA signals are displayed in two colors. The coloring aids
in distinguishing directional flow.

Oblique scan using linear probe

High-quality color Doppler images of oblique superficial blood
vessels can be acquired by oblique-scanning, while maintaining
the basic function of providing high-resolution B-mode imaging.
