Innovating the Digital Ultrasound Technology,


technology

From the transmission of
ultrasound beams to image
processing and post
processing, all functions are
fully digitized and

_ computerized. Is a result,
image quality and diagnostic

_ functions have been
improved and maximized.
Hitachi continues to be the
innovation in ultrasound
technology.


Digital Team Forming

Improving ultrasound beam quality through the use of digital beam forming technique.

@dQuadra Team
Receiving

Quadra beam receiving technology allows
the system to receive caustic data from
the patient at a rate four times faster. The
clinical greatly benefits from improved
images with detail collected using this high
line density processing system. Color flow
frame rates are also optimized for
maximum temporal resolution.

@ Dynamic Tissue Sardonic
Making (dTHI)

When the ultrasound passes through

the body, harmony distortion increases

by varying degrees.

By exacting higher harmony echo,

fine and high contrast image can be

depicted even at greater depths.

@ Two Dimensional (Of)

Team Apodisation
Expanding caustic aperture wider, the
transmitting beam can be converted
narrowed, but side loves are increased
relatively. However the grating side
loves can be reduced by emitting the
beam in fibrous profile.

Transmission wave in rectangular form
gives high emission power but it is
distorted to fusiform and effective
caustic energy is reduced practically.

Previously applying the fusiform profile
to the transmission wave, such
distortion can be preventive
eliminated.

These two dimensions, caustic wise
and time wise apodisation bring on
superior image quality.

Of apodisation

@Not Rousing
Technology

The number of focus points is increased
up to forming a dotted line through out
the entire field of scan line, by
microfocusing technology of continuous
aperture optimization.

Together with eight setting electronic
focused on transmission, sharp image is

available. y

@Rapid change-over time

Typically, one of the weak links in digital
ultrasound systems has been the delay
"change-over time" when selecting from
one transducer or application to another.
With the EUB-6000 there is virtually no
delay.

He never keep you waiting.

@Real-time plane imagine

The real-time plane imagine function
is the unique technique available only
from Pitch, which offers simultaneous
imagine of animal, and transaxial planes.
By adopting the real-time plane
technique to the esophageal probe,
simultaneous imagine of animal and
transaxial planes of the heart becomes
possible from the oesophagus.

the opportunity to observe anatomical
parts in preferred orientation.

@B-color imagine
Chances observation and detection by
highlighting in subtle shades and hue.

@ Maximum Field of View(FOV)
Hitachi's 200°sector entire probe
provides the clinical with the widest
field of view available allowing the
clinical to image even the smallest
details.

@Room Flexibility

Due to Quadra beam processing, the
EUB-6000 provides the clinical the
ability to room even after freezing the
image.


Optical Color Low Making...

Color Low Tapping(CFM)

Provides real-time observation in color of the dynamic state
and characteristics (flow direction, velocity, velocity variance,
etc.) of the blood flow in the abdominal, vascular, and other
regions.

Color Low Angiography(CFA)

Obtains image from the reflection intensity of blood flow
signals, and displays it overtopped on a B-Rode image.
Effective for directing very slow blood flows, such as that in
small vessels. Since the image is independent from blood flow
velocity, all flows from very slow to high speed are displayed
without discrimination.

Directional Color Low Angiography(Directional CFA)

The CFA signals are displayed in two colors. The coloring aids
in distinguishing direction flow.

Color hold mode display

Large line memory capacity enables multilayered storage of
selected color flow images for later retrieved and review.
Epics all vessels, even peripheral, without motion artifice
disturbance.

Weak hold mode display

Color flow images can be accumulated continuously for real-
time observation. Time span are selectable -- 1 see., 2 seas., 4
seas., or infinite -- and at the end of the given span, a fresh
sequence of images is provided. Extremely useful, particularly
for complicated screening exam.

Biomech Last Greinacea

Oblique scan using linear probe

High-quality color Copper images of oblique superficial blood
vessels can be acquired by oblique-scanning, while maintaining
the basic function of providing high-resolution B-mode imagine.

The EUB-6000 provides several standard calculation packages.
All of these packages can be customized by setting desired parameter

and applying basic measurement tools.
Clinicians are offered a new level of flexibility in obtaining specific measurement and reports.

@ Full range of basic
measurement

Distance, circumference, area, volume,
angle, and other basic measurement
are all provided and easily acquired.
Volume measurement can be obtained
simply by using the area-length, ellipse,
or plane methods.

@ Obstetrics measurement

A sophisticated obstetrical,

report function displays requisite
measurement data, fatal weight, fatal
and maternal anatomical status, ratio,
and clinical history. Standard growth
curves and previous exam data are
presented in graphics. All of the
information can be called up with a few
simple key strokes. Tables and
equations have been incorporated for
easy set-up, and are programmable
according to the user's specific needs.

@Lip-joint dislocation

angle measurement
A highly useful function for measuring the
angle of hip-joint dislocation in a newton
infant. The degree of severity is determined
by the angles of bony roof and cartilage roof.
Must input the joints to be measured and the
function automatically calculated the angles “«”
and “3”.

@ Geological measurement

Estimates hypertrophic volume and antigen
concentration from the volume

@ Color Copper flow rate
measurement

His innovative feature permits the flow
rate (typically obtained from pulse
Copper waveforms) to be measured
directly from a color Copper image.
Simply setting the calmer in the colored
area and the angle bar in the flow
direction provides prompt measurement
and display of the average flow rate.

@ Patient reports

His feature obtains the mean value by
recording repeated measurement, thus
minimizing the chance of measurement
errors. Measurement data is assembled
in the form of a patient report, which
can be reviewed on-screen or output as
hard copy.
